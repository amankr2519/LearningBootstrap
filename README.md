Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I am currently learning Bootstrap to build responsive and modern web designs. This repository showcases the projects I have built while exploring Bootstrap's features and components.
About

This repository is part of my journey to improve my front-end development skills. Each project here is built using Bootstrap 5 and focuses on:
    1) Responsive layouts using the Bootstrap grid system
    2) Utilizing built-in Bootstrap components like cards, navbars, modals, etc.
    3) Customizing styles with CSS
